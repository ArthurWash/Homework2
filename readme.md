This is my second homework assignment for my Java course at NJIT. This is my first Java program using a GUI. Here is the objective:

Design a window interface with a frame that has any light shade as background color (5 points). It should have three text fields (15 points), four radio buttons (20 points), and a label (for the equality sign, 5 points) as follows. 
Write a program such that if the user enters two integers on the text fields and click on any radio buttons the result of the operations appear in the third text field (15 points). The result of division is usually a non-integer and it should be handled correctly (10 points). Show the use of try-catch block (10 points). You must handle these situations and show a message dialogue box with appropriate message (10 points):
1)	Non integer inputs on one or both text fields.
2)	No input in one or both text fields.
3)	Division by zero.

# Edit 1
Created display w/ container, Set background color, created textfields.

# Edit 2
Added "=" Label.
